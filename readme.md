<p>This is a remake for TW5 of the plugin autotag of tiddlywiki classic created by Eric Shulman.
To be honest, it can not be called a remake since it only includes the only feature that was useful
for me: automatic tagging of tiddlers based on their content. </p><p>The tags are added **when the tiddler is saved.**
The plugin only add tags that exists already on the wiki. For example, if you have a tag called 'tiddler', or a tag called 'test', when you save a
tiddler with the sentence &quot;This tiddler is just a test&quot; it will be tagged with the tags 'tiddler' and 'test'.</p><p>You can try it out saving the tiddler below.
